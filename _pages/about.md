I am Litian Liang, a second-year Master's student in Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University, with an expected graduation in May 2025.

I am currently working on applications of LLMs in genomics data in Prof. [Carl Kingsford](https://kingsfordlab.cbd.cmu.edu/index.html)'s lab.

I received my B.S. in Data Science from Fudan University, where I worked on medical data analysis and few-shot learning in Computer Vision with Prof. [Yanwei Fu](http://yanweifu.github.io) and Prof. [Xinwei Sun](https://sunxinwei0625.github.io/sunxw.github.io/).
